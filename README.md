# xapi-team-alexa
xAPI Cohort Team Alexa Project. 
This project is built for the Winter Feb 2018 xAPI Cohort. 

**Initial Project Brief**
Here’s what I have so far:
1. Basic framework for the Alexa skill built
2. Testing mechanism
3. An LRS

**What is still needed:**
1. The actual voice design - the interaction. This should be a short 2-3 min skill 
2. A name for the skill
3. Deciding what data to track
4. Adding xAPI to the skill

I’ll create a google doc we can all work in if interested in taking an active role in this project. I am more than happy to setup live video sharing to show what all is involved

**Tools We Will Use**
For this Alexa skill xAPI project, I've already created the framework to develop the skill, so those who join my team channel can concentrate on the actual content of the project. We will be using a variety of tools for this project, including:

1. **Amazon Developer Website** (http://developer.amazon.com - this is where the Alexa skill is actually created using the Alexa Skills Kit.
2. **Amazon AWS Console** (http://aws.amazon.com) - this is where the code for the Alexa skill will actually live. I'm using Lambda which is a serverless environment. You can learn more about Lambda here.
3. **Google Docs** - as people join the team, we'll use this to write out the actual voice interaction document.
4. **SaySpring.com** (http://sayspring.com) - we will use this to test the actual voice interaction script to make sure the script sounds right when played back before it's coded.
5. **Repl.it** (http://repl.it) - this is a web-based Integrated Development Environment aka IDE. I'll use this to actually write the JavaScript code for the project.
6. **Echosim.io** (http://echosim.io)  - this tool is used to simulate an Alexa device. We will use it to test the interaction with our skill the way a user would. The cool things about this tool is that when you connect to it using the same account you use to create your skill, it will link to all the skills you've created and you can call each on to action using the skill name to test it.
7. **WaxLRS** (http://saltbox.com) - this is the Learning Record Store (LR) system that we will use to capture the xAPI statements.
8. **xAPI** - of course, the project would not be complete without the integration of xAPI. Since I've never tried integrating xAPI with an Alexa skill I'm going to treat it the same way I would a website and use the xAPI Wrapper to... well wrap my code. The wrapper has a bunch of functionalities built into it taking the burden off me when I get coding.
