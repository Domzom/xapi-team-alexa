# xapi-team-alexa
xAPI Cohort Team Alexa Project. 
This project is built for the Winter Feb 2018 xAPI Cohort. 
Credits:
* **Samantha Lowe** - Created the Original Tornado Test story.
* **Henry Ring and Erika Nelsen** - collaborated on the story
* **Bryan Wanzer and Myra Roldan** - worked on coding the project, deciding which skills template to use and ultimately building and troubleshooting the skill until it worked. YAY! Bryan for being the keen troubleshooter we needed. Without him this project probably would have failed. 

**Final Product**
We were able to complete a decision game Alexa skill that is xAPI enabled. The process wasn't as straight forward as we hoped but we were able to figure it out. We have added instructions for create a _Lambda function_ that is required for your skill to work. I will add instructions for the steps you need to follow to create the Alexa skill using the Alexa skill builder in the developer console. 

**Tools We Used**
For this Alexa skill xAPI project, we used a variety of tools for this project, including:

1. **Amazon Developer Website** (http://developer.amazon.com - this is where the Alexa skill is actually created using the Alexa Skills Kit.
2. **Amazon AWS Console** (http://aws.amazon.com) - this is where the code for the Alexa skill will actually live. I'm using Lambda which is a serverless environment. You can learn more about Lambda here.
3. **Google Docs** - as people join the team, we'll use this to write out the actual voice interaction document.
4. **Twine** (http://twinery.org) - we used Twine to create a branching for our story. You can use the online or desktop version of Twine to build your story. Just make sure to test the functionality in Twine before publishing your file. 
5. **codeshare** (http://codeshare.io) - this is a web-based Integrated Development Environment aka IDE. We used this to actually write the JavaScript code for the project.
6. **Echosim.io** (http://echosim.io)  - this tool is used to simulate an Alexa device. We will use it to test the interaction with our skill the way a user would. The cool things about this tool is that when you connect to it using the same account you use to create your skill, it will link to all the skills you've created and you can call each on to action using the skill name to test it.
7. **WaxLRS** (http://saltbox.com) - this is the Learning Record Store (LR) system that we will use to capture the xAPI statements.
8. **xAPI** - of course, the project would not be complete without the integration of xAPI. Since I've never tried integrating xAPI with an Alexa skill I'm going to treat it the same way I would a website and use the xAPI Wrapper to... well wrap my code. The wrapper has a bunch of functionalities built into it taking the burden off me when I get coding.
**Alexa Skills Template** - we used an existing skills template which really helped cut down on the amount of coding we had to do

**To begin building your Alexa skill - create your Voice User Interface (VUI) in Twine and publish your story. Then follow the [instructions here ](https://github.com/mirarol/xapi-team-alexa/blob/master/interaction%20models/developer-instructions.md)
